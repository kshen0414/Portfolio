- Today, implemented a new section which is the experiences div
- hmmm, i am wondering how to make specific sections stick?? I remember i saw a tutorial teaching this somewhere
- tbh, another implementation i would like is to probably make it like a fade in effect when i restart the webpage?? Hahahha would definitely look cool in my opinion

Problems
- hmmm, don't know why after, adding data-aos = "fade-left" but no effect eh???
- to note that this library is called animate on scroll
